"Please make sure that federally qualified health centers continue to receive adequate reimbursement and that there is no hospital led efforts to minimize those reimbursements throughout the process. As hospitals continue to purchase primary care practices, they are under more pressure to corner those Medicaid dollars, leaving a poor payer mix for FQHC's."

"The Medicaid reform proposal ignores some highly pertinent facts and is not in the best interest of our state. The format suggested will be cumbersome to formulate and will add layers of bureaucratic complexity to the Medicaid system in North Carolina.
This terribly divisive proposal ignores the fact that the NC Medicaid system is nationally recognized as doing well. It has over 90% of primary care and many specialists with support by nonprofit Community Care of NC which is a consortium of 14 nonprofit entities covering all 100 counties. It works with every hospital in NC, with thousands of private practicing physicians, with every county health department, with all 34 federally qualified health centers, and with all 27 rural health centers. CCNC is a model which numerous other states have tried to emulate.
While enrollment growth has generated an increase in total costs, the per capita cost of healthcare for Medicaid patients in NC has gone down since 2010. There was a 4% decrease in 2011, and by 2015 a greater than 8% reduction as compared with 2010. No Medicaid program in any other state has had such experience. In fact, no commercial insurance company nor any MCO can show such results. What is the logic of disrupting such a successful homegrown system with for-profit MCOs that will cost more and generate aggravations for the provider community?
Notable is that these cost savings under the current system have accrued through improved clinical outcomes for patients, resulting in less emergency department visits and less hospitalizations.
In recent 12 public hearings across the state over 100 physicians to speak expressed disapproval of the reform plan and spoke in support of CCNC. They also voiced serious concerns for having to deal with multiple entities within the Medicaid system to gain reimbursement for services delivered.
At these hearings were repeated pleas for NC to shrink the uninsured population by accepting the federal money that has been allocated to expand Medicaid in our state. To do so would help the economy in every county across NC, especially in the less affluent regions. It would generate jobs and be a huge boost to hospitals and safety net clinics.
NC has a model Medicaid system that has a proven track record for decreasing per capita costs that no other state nor any MCO can rival. Rather than scuttle it, pragmatic good sense calls for its expansion. Let's do what is best for the people of North Carolina.

"As an employee of a Western North Carolina Community Health Center and also a Certified Application Counselor, I see firsthand the lives impacted by North Carolina's rejection of Medicaid Expansion. This affects the health and well-being of real people, such as a 63 year old retiree on a fixed income - too low for ACA subsidies but categorically ineligible for Medicaid in NC; a mother making minimum wage, whose income turns out to be higher than North Carolina's ridiculously low limit for parents yet under 100% FPL so again, ineligible for ACA subsidies; or a chronically ill middle-aged man who finds it difficult to work as he has gout, cannot afford out-of pocket healthcare that could ease his pain, and therefore cannot work enough to qualify for subsidies on the exchange. These are just a sampling of the likely half of a million people who are unable to access healthcare and are suffering as a result of living in the Medicaid Gap.

As the federal agency enabled to review the NC medicaid reform proposal, I believe that you should make Medicaid Expansion a condition of any reform proposal. People who really need medical assistance, our most vulnerable, poverty-stricken populations, should have access to life-saving medical care."
